# Basic Feed Forward Dense Neural Network
I know how to program a neural network from scratch, so why not do it?
I have only added the feed forward aspect of the network for now.
I will add different optimizers for it as I go along.

One optimizer I have already made is my idea of how a [genetic algorithm optimizer](https://github.com/ElanVB/genetic_optimizer_nn) should look like.

I am also going to build on this code, make it more efficient, add more functionality, etc.
